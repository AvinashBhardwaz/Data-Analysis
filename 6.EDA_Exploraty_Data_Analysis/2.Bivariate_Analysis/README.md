# Bivariate Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on Bivariate Analysis using various datasets. It employs visualizations to explore the relationship between two variables. The analysis includes scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps to uncover patterns and insights in the data.

## Datasets Used
- **Titanic Dataset:** A dataset containing information about Titanic passengers, used for analyzing survival rates.
- **Tips Dataset:** Contains information about tips given in a restaurant setting.
- **Flights Dataset:** A dataset that records the number of passengers for different months across years.
- **Iris Dataset:** A classic dataset for exploring flower species based on different measurements.

## Things Covered
- Visualizing relationships between categorical and numerical variables.
- Understanding distributions of data through box plots and histograms.
- Using heatmaps to analyze correlations between variables.
- Exploring multi-dimensional relationships with pair plots.

## Expected Interview Questions
- What is the difference between univariate and bivariate analysis?
- How would you interpret a scatter plot?
- What are the advantages of using box plots?
- How do you handle outliers in your analysis?
- Can you explain the importance of correlation and how it differs from causation?

## Future Aspects to Learn in AI
- Advanced data visualization techniques and libraries.
- Machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis.
- Deep learning models for complex data interpretation.
- Natural language processing for extracting insights from unstructured data.
- Time series analysis for forecasting trends.
