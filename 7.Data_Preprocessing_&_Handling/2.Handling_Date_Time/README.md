## Data Preprocessing & Handling

This project focuses on the preprocessing of data, specifically handling dates, times, and mixed variables in datasets using **pandas** and **NumPy** in Python.

### Sections Covered:

1. Handling Mixed Variables
2. Working with Dates and Time (Latest Addition)
3. Complete Case Analysis (Upcoming)
4. Imputing Numerical Data (Upcoming)
5. Handling Missing Categorical Data (Upcoming)
6. Missing Indicator (Upcoming)
7. KNN Imputer (Upcoming)
8. Iterative Imputer (Upcoming)
9. Outlier Handling (Upcoming)

### Key Learnings So Far:
- Conversion of string data to **datetime** format
- Extracting date components such as **year, month,** and **day**
- Handling **weekdays** and determining **weekends**
- Working with **quarters** and **semesters**
- Calculating time differences in **days, months, hours, minutes,** and **seconds**
- Extracting time components such as **hour, minute,** and **second**
