## Overview
In this section, we explore techniques for handling mixed variables in datasets. Mixed variables often contain both categorical and numerical data, making them challenging to analyze. This guide demonstrates how to effectively separate and manage these variables using the Titanic dataset.

## Key Concepts Covered
- Extraction of numerical and categorical components from mixed variables
- Handling of categorical data in columns like 'Cabin' and 'Ticket'
- Visualization of distributions for better understanding

## Steps
1. Load the Titanic dataset.
2. Identify mixed variables and extract their components.
3. Visualize the distribution of extracted categories.

## Requirements
To run this section, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas library
- NumPy library
- Matplotlib library
- Seaborn library

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
